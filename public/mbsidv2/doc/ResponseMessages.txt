 Acknowledge:

    Master SID (Device ID 00)
      <sids>: contains flags for the SID cores which have processed the
      previous SysEx string successfully.

      Note that the destination SIDs can be selected with ...0C 00 <sids>...
      If SID cores are not available, or have been disconnected during
      runtime, the appr. flags in the acknowledge response are automatically
      cleared to notify about this

   Slave SID (Device ID 01, 02, 03)
      <sids> is always 00
